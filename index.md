  #Portland Bike Theft Dashboard
  ##An app that analyzes bike thefts in Portland, Oregon from 2007 to 2014.
  
  --- .class #id 

In Portland, Oregon there were at least 13,000 bike thefts between 2007 and 2014. I say "at least" because a large number of bike thefts are likely to go unreported. These 13,000 were only the thefts that were reported to the Portland Police Bureau.

Earlier this year, PPB (along with Project 529 and BikeIndex.org) convened the Bike Theft Taskforce.
